# XDG Desktop Portal Aperture

This is a work-in progress XDG-DESKTOP-PORTAL implementation for settings and style.
The only purpose of this is a desktop-environment independent settings portal.

It does not and will not provide any other functionality. For that, please use an existing one like KDE or GTK.
