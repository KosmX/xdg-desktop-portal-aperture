# XDG Desktop Portal Aperture

## UNFINISHED
This portal is not finished yet, I'm working on it, but it's not functional yet.

---

This is a work-in progress XDG-DESKTOP-PORTAL implementation for settings and style.
The only purpose of this is a desktop-environment independent settings portal.

It does not and will not provide any other functionality. For that, please use an existing one like KDE or GTK.
